LSKD2019 Introduction to Machine Learning
=========================================
This folder contains the resources and notebooks I used for teaching the LSKD2019
introduction to machine learning practical.

1. [Part 1](https://github.com/cthoyt/notebooks/blob/master/LSKD2019/LSKD%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning%202019%20(Part%201).ipynb) was about understanding the Breast Cancer data set from university of Wisconsin then applying some classifiers to it. It can better be found on [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cthoyt/notebooks/blob/master/LSKD2019/LSKD%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning%202019%20%28Part%201%29.ipynb)
