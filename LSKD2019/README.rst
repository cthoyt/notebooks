LSKD2019 Introduction to Machine Learning
=========================================
This folder contains the resources and notebooks I used for teaching the LSKD2019
introduction to machine learning practical.

Notebooks
---------
1. `Part 1 <https://github.com/cthoyt/notebooks/blob/master/LSKD2019/LSKD%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning%202019%20(Part%201).ipynb>`_ was about understanding the Breast Cancer data set from university of Wisconsin then applying some classifiers to it. Because it has lots of graphics,  `NBViewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cthoyt/notebooks/blob/master/LSKD2019/LSKD%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning%202019%20%28Part%201%29.ipynb>`_ might work better than GitHub.
2. `Part 2 <https://github.com/cthoyt/notebooks/blob/master/LSKD2019/LSKD%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning%202019%20(Part%202).ipynb>`_ was about multi-class classifiers, feature selection, preprocessing, and evaluation. Because it has lots of graphics, `NBViewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cthoyt/notebooks/blob/master/LSKD2019/LSKD%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning%202019%20%28Part%202%29.ipynb>`_ might work better than GitHub.
3. `Part 3 <https://github.com/cthoyt/notebooks/blob/master/LSKD2019/LSKD%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning%202019%20(Part%203).ipynb>`_ was about regression models and their applications to the Diabetes data set. Because it has lots of graphics, `NBViewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cthoyt/notebooks/blob/master/LSKD2019/LSKD%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning%202019%20%28Part%203%29.ipynb>`_ might work better than GitHub.
4. `Part 4 <https://github.com/cthoyt/notebooks/blob/master/LSKD2019/LSKD%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning%202019%20(Part%204).ipynb>`_ was about Game of Thrones. It included acquisition and preparation of real-world data (the character co-occurrence matrix throughout the series) and application of network representation learning to generate euclidean vectors representing each character. These were used for downstream machine learning tasks like anomaly detection and clustering. Because it has lots of graphics, `NBViewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cthoyt/notebooks/blob/master/LSKD2019/LSKD%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning%202019%20%28Part%204%29.ipynb>`_ might work better than GitHub.
